Intellectual Capital
More than 2500 academic and research staff, many leaders in their fields with international reputations provide stimulating learning environment and excellent standards of teaching. Even though it is a self-financing institution, KIIT is a well structured and decentralized organization. It is the only self-financing institution in the country where top functionaries, including Chancellor and Vice Chancellor are renowned academicians. The quality is amply demonstrated by the patents held by various faculty members, the research grants coming from various agencies both in India and abroad, national and international conferences, symposiums and workshops held here and hundred percent placement records.

Content from link 6: https://kiit.ac.in/campuslife/sports/
Welcome to the dynamic world of sports at KIIT & KISS, where we champion the ethos of holistic development through sports. Under the visionary leadership of Dr. Samanta, our institutions have become synonymous with sporting excellence and innovation, mirroring the standards of the best universities globally.
At KIIT & KISS, sports are not just activities but a way of life, integral to our educational philosophy. Our commitment is reflected in our world-class infrastructure, encompassing a vast athletics stadium, state-of-the-art cricket and rugby grounds, a velodrome, and a multitude of sports complexes. These facilities not only cater to the needs of our athletes but also serve as a fertile ground for nurturing future champions.
Unique Recognition






At KIIT & KISS, the inception of a sporting legacy began with Dr. Samanta’s pioneering vision. Recognising the transformative power of sports, akin to models in Western universities, Dr. Samanta embarked on a mission to create an unparalleled sporting infrastructure. His dedication has been instrumental in fostering a culture where sports are synonymous with recreation, wellness, and mental fortitude..
KIIT’s sports infrastructure is a testament to excellence. With facilities like an expansive athletics stadium, cricket and rugby grounds, a velodrome, and a combined hockey/football stadium, KIIT stands as a beacon of international standard sports infrastructure. Complemented by 18 sports complexes, Olympic-sized swimming pools, and high-performance gyms, KIIT’s facilities are lauded by dignitaries and sporting legends alike.
KIIT & KISS are not just about world-class facilities but are the nurturing ground for over 300 dedicated sports personnel and 5000+ tribal athletes. The success stories range from international medallists to champions in various national and school-level competitions. KIIT & KISS are the epitomes of sporting prowess, making significant contributions to India’s sporting landscape.
Embracing inclusivity, KIIT & KISS have made monumental strides in introducing sports like Rugby and Chess, with KISS being the first in India to integrate Chess into its academic curriculum. The institutions’ commitment to inclusivity is further highlighted through establishing sports academies and introducing sports in rural areas, fostering a diverse range of talents.
With 12 Olympians already part of the KIIT family, Dr. Samanta’s ambition doesn’t rest. The goal is now set to send 10 more athletes to the 2024 Olympics. This relentless pursuit of excellence ensures that KIIT & KISS are not just universities but talent incubators, poised to redefine India’s sports narrative.
Dr. Samanta’s vision extends beyond current achievements. His aim is to instil quality sporting facilities in schools and colleges, ensuring that future stars are nurtured from the grassroots level. This model, if emulated by other universities, can revolutionise sports in India.

Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar had the proud distinction to be the host university of the inaugural Khelo India University Games (KIUG) 2020 held from February 22 to March 1, 2020. The largest-of-its-kind sports extravaganza was inaugurated by Shri Narendra Modi, Hon’ble Prime Minister of India through video conferencing in the presence of Chief Guest, Shri Naveen Patnaik, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Odisha and a host of dignitaries. For nine days, KIIT campus turned into mini-India as 4000 top athletes from 250 universities from across the country showcased their talent in 34 events spanning 17 sports disciplines.
KIUG 2020 is the most prestigious meet yet under the Govt. of India’s flagship Khelo India, a national programme for the development of sports launched in 2018 and a dream project of the Prime Minister. The multi-discipline meet is slated to be an annual event under the aegis of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Govt. of India, Ministry of HRD, Sports Authority of India (SAI) and Association of Indian Universities (AIU). It is not surprising that the inaugural edition came to Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, which of late has emerged as the sporting capital of the country. The Govt. of Odisha and the Chief Minister provided all kinds of support and cooperation to make the meet a huge success

Intellectual Capital
More than 2500 academic and research staff, many leaders in their fields with international reputations provide stimulating learning environment and excellent standards of teaching. Even though it is a self-financing institution, KIIT is a well structured and decentralized organization. It is the only self-financing institution in the country where top functionaries, including Chancellor and Vice Chancellor are renowned academicians. The quality is amply demonstrated by the patents held by various faculty members, the research grants coming from various agencies both in India and abroad, national and international conferences, symposiums and workshops held here and hundred percent placement records.

Content from link 20: https://kiit.ac.in/campuslife/sports/
Welcome to the dynamic world of sports at KIIT & KISS, where we champion the ethos of holistic development through sports. Under the visionary leadership of Dr. Samanta, our institutions have become synonymous with sporting excellence and innovation, mirroring the standards of the best universities globally.
At KIIT & KISS, sports are not just activities but a way of life, integral to our educational philosophy. Our commitment is reflected in our world-class infrastructure, encompassing a vast athletics stadium, state-of-the-art cricket and rugby grounds, a velodrome, and a multitude of sports complexes. These facilities not only cater to the needs of our athletes but also serve as a fertile ground for nurturing future champions.
Unique Recognition






At KIIT & KISS, the inception of a sporting legacy began with Dr. Samanta’s pioneering vision. Recognising the transformative power of sports, akin to models in Western universities, Dr. Samanta embarked on a mission to create an unparalleled sporting infrastructure. His dedication has been instrumental in fostering a culture where sports are synonymous with recreation, wellness, and mental fortitude..
KIIT’s sports infrastructure is a testament to excellence. With facilities like an expansive athletics stadium, cricket and rugby grounds, a velodrome, and a combined hockey/football stadium, KIIT stands as a beacon of international standard sports infrastructure. Complemented by 18 sports complexes, Olympic-sized swimming pools, and high-performance gyms, KIIT’s facilities are lauded by dignitaries and sporting legends alike.
KIIT & KISS are not just about world-class facilities but are the nurturing ground for over 300 dedicated sports personnel and 5000+ tribal athletes. The success stories range from international medallists to champions in various national and school-level competitions. KIIT & KISS are the epitomes of sporting prowess, making significant contributions to India’s sporting landscape.
Embracing inclusivity, KIIT & KISS have made monumental strides in introducing sports like Rugby and Chess, with KISS being the first in India to integrate Chess into its academic curriculum. The institutions’ commitment to inclusivity is further highlighted through establishing sports academies and introducing sports in rural areas, fostering a diverse range of talents.
With 12 Olympians already part of the KIIT family, Dr. Samanta’s ambition doesn’t rest. The goal is now set to send 10 more athletes to the 2024 Olympics. This relentless pursuit of excellence ensures that KIIT & KISS are not just universities but talent incubators, poised to redefine India’s sports narrative.
Dr. Samanta’s vision extends beyond current achievements. His aim is to instil quality sporting facilities in schools and colleges, ensuring that future stars are nurtured from the grassroots level. This model, if emulated by other universities, can revolutionise sports in India.

Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar had the proud distinction to be the host university of the inaugural Khelo India University Games (KIUG) 2020 held from February 22 to March 1, 2020. The largest-of-its-kind sports extravaganza was inaugurated by Shri Narendra Modi, Hon’ble Prime Minister of India through video conferencing in the presence of Chief Guest, Shri Naveen Patnaik, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Odisha and a host of dignitaries. For nine days, KIIT campus turned into mini-India as 4000 top athletes from 250 universities from across the country showcased their talent in 34 events spanning 17 sports disciplines.
KIUG 2020 is the most prestigious meet yet under the Govt. of India’s flagship Khelo India, a national programme for the development of sports launched in 2018 and a dream project of the Prime Minister. The multi-discipline meet is slated to be an annual event under the aegis of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Govt. of India, Ministry of HRD, Sports Authority of India (SAI) and Association of Indian Universities (AIU). It is not surprising that the inaugural edition came to Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, which of late has emerged as the sporting capital of the country. The Govt. of Odisha and the Chief Minister provided all kinds of support and cooperation to make the meet a huge success

Overview
Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), a household name in the education sector, has become a sought-after destination in India for professional studies. It is admired all over for the quality of its academic courses, its community outreach work and as a university of compassion and humanitarianism. It has become a case study because no other educational institution in India has grown in its scope and scale as much as KIIT has in a short span of 25 years. Its incredible transformation is truly a journey from Soil to Silver.
KIIT started in 1992-93 as an Industrial Training Institution. However, 1997 is considered the base year for the University as undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Engineering, Management and Computer Applications were added. In 2007, many new schools were added to its umbrella – School of Law, Biotechnology, Medical Sciences, Dental Sciences, Nursing, Mass Communication, Film and Media, Fashion and KIIT International School. Since then, there has been no looking back! Today, KIIT offers professional education to around 40,000 students from across India. This includes 2000 international students from 65 countries. The alumni of KIIT, over a lakh of them, have made their mark in their respective careers in academics, corporate organizations, civil services and enterprise.
One would find it difficult to imagine that such a celebrated institution with a global reputation was established by an unassuming humble being, Dr Achyuta Samanta, the Founder of KIIT and KISS, who started the institute with all of Rs 5000 as the initial investment. He had big dreams and a passion to make a difference. Dr Samanta started KIIT in two rented rooms with 12 students and 2 staff. The modest institution has now grown to incomprehensible propositions and is spread over a vast 36-square-kilometre academic township. Its 25 lush green campuses employ over 3000 eminent faculty and researchers and 15000 staff. KIIT and KISS together is a family of over a lakh people. The campus houses a 2600-bedded super speciality hospital, KIMS, a multi-storey central library, a central research facility, a 22-storey research and innovation wing, auditoriums – the largest one with 5000 seating capacity, 18 sports complexes, many international standard stadiums covering all sports, 30 food courts, and a rose garden. The institution takes pride in being the greenest campus in India.
It has received all accreditations and affiliations from prestigious national and international bodies such as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), USA and the Institution of Engineering and Technology, (IET), UK because of its quality research, innovation, and publications and citations. KIIT has had an excellent placement record since its inception owing to its quality teaching and learning process, and the brand value that it carries. KIIT is ranked in the cohort of 601-800 in the Times Higher Education ‘World University Ranking 2024’. Its Computer Science Engineering ranks in the cohort of 301-400 and its overall Engineering ranking is 401-500 in the world. KIIT has been accredited with an A++ grade by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with an all-India 15th rank by the National Institution of Ranking Framework, NIRF, Ministry of Education. It has also been the top university for innovation among private institutions for two consecutive years (2020, 2021) according to AICTE, Government of India. It has been ranked 168 among universities in the world as per the Times Higher Education Young University Ranking 2024.
KIIT has made colossal contributions to sports, having produced 23 Olympians. The University has been honoured with the CII Sportstar Award, FICCI India Sports Award, and Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puruskar 2022 for its outstanding promotion of sports and encouragement through Corporate Social Responsibility. Additionally, KIIT and KISS serve as the nodal centres for the FIFA Football for Schools Programme in Asia. Beyond its immense contributions to the development of the state and the city, KIIT has also promoted local art, culture, sculpture, rural development, literature, and spiritualism. All these achievements have been possible because of its founder, Dr. Achyuta Samanta—lovingly called Samanta Sir—who embodies principles, discipline, hard work, and selfless service. It truly is an inspiring story of a humble man steering two institutions to glory despite all the hardships and struggles.

Why KIIT is named so?
KIIT – Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology derives its name from a combination of historical, geographical, and symbolic elements, reflecting the institution’s journey and vision over the years. The name “Kalinga” pays tribute to the ancient region of Kalinga, which was situated in present-day Odisha. Kalinga holds significant historical importance, known for its rich heritage and contributions to culture and learning. Notably, it is also remembered for the Kalinga War, where Emperor Ashoka’s conquest of Kalinga led to a profound transformation in his life as he embraced the path of non-violence and peace. By incorporating “Kalinga” in its name, KIIT aims to draw inspiration from this historical legacy of peace and enlightenment.
KIIT’s journey began as an Industrial Training Institute (ITI) before evolving into a full-fledged university. Therefore, the initial inclusion of “IIT” in the name represented its humble origins and focus on technical education. Over the years, KIIT has witnessed remarkable growth and expansion, offering diverse disciplines and becoming a prominent center for professional education and research. The evolution from “ITI” to a world-famous university, KIIT is a story of progress in becoming a comprehensive educational hub.
The letter “K” in the name can be attributed to a fascination with the symbolism of this letter as a lucky charm by its Founder, Dr. Achyuta Samanta. The letter “K” has come to represent a symbol of prosperity and success, guiding its path as it continues to grow and make strides in the field of education. Starting from his birthplace to his Gotra (clan) and everything created by him till now starts with “K” and ends with success.
The name “KIIT” is a thoughtful blend of history, origins, growth, and a touch of symbolism, embodying the institution’s commitment to providing quality education and being the University of humanity and compassion, fostering peace, and embracing the journey of progress and transformation.

KIIT was established in 1992 as a vocational training centre with only two staff and 12 students. However, it took shape as an institution only in 1997, when degree engineering programme commenced. KIIT owes its existence to the vision of its founder Prof. Achyuta Samanta who, with no land, limited finances (only Rs. 5000/-) and little knowledge of higher education, created an institution for the benefit of the society. From these small beginnings, KIIT has developed into a leading university with a strong interdisciplinary culture and a commitment to teaching excellence.

Prof Achyuta Samanta’s life story reads like a powerful saga of grit, determination, and social responsibility. Born and brought up in poverty in a remote village in Odisha, he was dealt a cruel blow at the tender age of four when he lost his father, after which his life became a struggle for food and education for 15 long years. However, he persevered, and at the age of 22, joined teaching. At 25, he embarked on a journey that would change his own life, and the lives of thousands of people. With just Rs 5000 in his pocket, he started KIIT (Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology) and KISS (Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences) in two rented houses.
Today, these institutions are beacons of hope, providing world-class education, decorated with all possible national and international accolades and global reputation. KIIT has become one of the most sought-after universities in India for professional education. It currently has 40,000 students and representation from 65 countries. KISS is a ray of hope for tribals, providing education, healthcare, sports, and vocational training to 80,000 disadvantaged students – all fully free in a residential campus. KISS has a school, a college, and a university – KISS Deemed to be University, which is the first and only university exclusively for tribal scholars providing innovative tribal courses. KISS has made a huge impact in arresting naxalism, harassment, trafficking, malnutrition, illiteracy, and superstitions by promoting education. He has founded Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, Kalinga Institute of Dental Sciences and Kalinga Institute of Nursing Sciences, besides an attached 2600 bedded state-of-the-art hospital, a super-specialty center and a cancer care hospital.
He developed the first smart village in Asia – Kalarabanka Smart Village and a model panchayat in Odisha. It is a fully solar-powered village. Besides education and tribal upliftment, Prof Samanta has also contributed immensely to art, culture, sculpture, literature, film, media, spirituality, rural development, and his humanitarian contribution to society is awe-inspiring. His contribution to Sports is nothing short of phenomenal. Through his institutions, he has nurtured 23 Olympians & 3 Paralympians, created a massive sports infrastructure and promoted sports persons – contributing to physical fitness, national unity, and social integration. His humanitarian efforts have touched countless lives. Despite all his achievements and accolades and access to luxuries, he leads a simple life and remains a bachelor who embodies humility and compassion.
Prof Achyuta Samanta’s life story is one of inspiration and hope. It is a testament to the indomitable human spirit, and the power of hard work, perseverance, and social responsibility to transform lives and create a better world. His unwavering commitment to the betterment of society, both as a policymaker and a social activist, serves as a shining example for one and all.

Overview
Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), a household name in the education sector, has become a sought-after destination in India for professional studies. It is admired all over for the quality of its academic courses, its community outreach work and as a university of compassion and humanitarianism. It has become a case study because no other educational institution in India has grown in its scope and scale as much as KIIT has in a short span of 25 years. Its incredible transformation is truly a journey from Soil to Silver.
KIIT started in 1992-93 as an Industrial Training Institution. However, 1997 is considered the base year for the University as undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Engineering, Management and Computer Applications were added. In 2007, many new schools were added to its umbrella – School of Law, Biotechnology, Medical Sciences, Dental Sciences, Nursing, Mass Communication, Film and Media, Fashion and KIIT International School. Since then, there has been no looking back! Today, KIIT offers professional education to around 40,000 students from across India. This includes 2000 international students from 65 countries. The alumni of KIIT, over a lakh of them, have made their mark in their respective careers in academics, corporate organizations, civil services and enterprise.
One would find it difficult to imagine that such a celebrated institution with a global reputation was established by an unassuming humble being, Dr Achyuta Samanta, the Founder of KIIT and KISS, who started the institute with all of Rs 5000 as the initial investment. He had big dreams and a passion to make a difference. Dr Samanta started KIIT in two rented rooms with 12 students and 2 staff. The modest institution has now grown to incomprehensible propositions and is spread over a vast 36-square-kilometre academic township. Its 25 lush green campuses employ over 3000 eminent faculty and researchers and 15000 staff. KIIT and KISS together is a family of over a lakh people. The campus houses a 2600-bedded super speciality hospital, KIMS, a multi-storey central library, a central research facility, a 22-storey research and innovation wing, auditoriums – the largest one with 5000 seating capacity, 18 sports complexes, many international standard stadiums covering all sports, 30 food courts, and a rose garden. The institution takes pride in being the greenest campus in India.
It has received all accreditations and affiliations from prestigious national and international bodies such as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), USA and the Institution of Engineering and Technology, (IET), UK because of its quality research, innovation, and publications and citations. KIIT has had an excellent placement record since its inception owing to its quality teaching and learning process, and the brand value that it carries. KIIT is ranked in the cohort of 601-800 in the Times Higher Education ‘World University Ranking 2024’. Its Computer Science Engineering ranks in the cohort of 301-400 and its overall Engineering ranking is 401-500 in the world. KIIT has been accredited with an A++ grade by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with an all-India 15th rank by the National Institution of Ranking Framework, NIRF, Ministry of Education. It has also been the top university for innovation among private institutions for two consecutive years (2020, 2021) according to AICTE, Government of India. It has been ranked 168 among universities in the world as per the Times Higher Education Young University Ranking 2024.
KIIT has made colossal contributions to sports, having produced 23 Olympians. The University has been honoured with the CII Sportstar Award, FICCI India Sports Award, and Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puruskar 2022 for its outstanding promotion of sports and encouragement through Corporate Social Responsibility. Additionally, KIIT and KISS serve as the nodal centres for the FIFA Football for Schools Programme in Asia. Beyond its immense contributions to the development of the state and the city, KIIT has also promoted local art, culture, sculpture, rural development, literature, and spiritualism. All these achievements have been possible because of its founder, Dr. Achyuta Samanta—lovingly called Samanta Sir—who embodies principles, discipline, hard work, and selfless service. It truly is an inspiring story of a humble man steering two institutions to glory despite all the hardships and struggles.

Why KIIT is named so?
KIIT – Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology derives its name from a combination of historical, geographical, and symbolic elements, reflecting the institution’s journey and vision over the years. The name “Kalinga” pays tribute to the ancient region of Kalinga, which was situated in present-day Odisha. Kalinga holds significant historical importance, known for its rich heritage and contributions to culture and learning. Notably, it is also remembered for the Kalinga War, where Emperor Ashoka’s conquest of Kalinga led to a profound transformation in his life as he embraced the path of non-violence and peace. By incorporating “Kalinga” in its name, KIIT aims to draw inspiration from this historical legacy of peace and enlightenment.
KIIT’s journey began as an Industrial Training Institute (ITI) before evolving into a full-fledged university. Therefore, the initial inclusion of “IIT” in the name represented its humble origins and focus on technical education. Over the years, KIIT has witnessed remarkable growth and expansion, offering diverse disciplines and becoming a prominent center for professional education and research. The evolution from “ITI” to a world-famous university, KIIT is a story of progress in becoming a comprehensive educational hub.
The letter “K” in the name can be attributed to a fascination with the symbolism of this letter as a lucky charm by its Founder, Dr. Achyuta Samanta. The letter “K” has come to represent a symbol of prosperity and success, guiding its path as it continues to grow and make strides in the field of education. Starting from his birthplace to his Gotra (clan) and everything created by him till now starts with “K” and ends with success.
The name “KIIT” is a thoughtful blend of history, origins, growth, and a touch of symbolism, embodying the institution’s commitment to providing quality education and being the University of humanity and compassion, fostering peace, and embracing the journey of progress and transformation.

KIIT was established in 1992 as a vocational training centre with only two staff and 12 students. However, it took shape as an institution only in 1997, when degree engineering programme commenced. KIIT owes its existence to the vision of its founder Prof. Achyuta Samanta who, with no land, limited finances (only Rs. 5000/-) and little knowledge of higher education, created an institution for the benefit of the society. From these small beginnings, KIIT has developed into a leading university with a strong interdisciplinary culture and a commitment to teaching excellence.

Prof Achyuta Samanta’s life story reads like a powerful saga of grit, determination, and social responsibility. Born and brought up in poverty in a remote village in Odisha, he was dealt a cruel blow at the tender age of four when he lost his father, after which his life became a struggle for food and education for 15 long years. However, he persevered, and at the age of 22, joined teaching. At 25, he embarked on a journey that would change his own life, and the lives of thousands of people. With just Rs 5000 in his pocket, he started KIIT (Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology) and KISS (Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences) in two rented houses.
Today, these institutions are beacons of hope, providing world-class education, decorated with all possible national and international accolades and global reputation. KIIT has become one of the most sought-after universities in India for professional education. It currently has 40,000 students and representation from 65 countries. KISS is a ray of hope for tribals, providing education, healthcare, sports, and vocational training to 80,000 disadvantaged students – all fully free in a residential campus. KISS has a school, a college, and a university – KISS Deemed to be University, which is the first and only university exclusively for tribal scholars providing innovative tribal courses. KISS has made a huge impact in arresting naxalism, harassment, trafficking, malnutrition, illiteracy, and superstitions by promoting education. He has founded Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, Kalinga Institute of Dental Sciences and Kalinga Institute of Nursing Sciences, besides an attached 2600 bedded state-of-the-art hospital, a super-specialty center and a cancer care hospital.
He developed the first smart village in Asia – Kalarabanka Smart Village and a model panchayat in Odisha. It is a fully solar-powered village. Besides education and tribal upliftment, Prof Samanta has also contributed immensely to art, culture, sculpture, literature, film, media, spirituality, rural development, and his humanitarian contribution to society is awe-inspiring. His contribution to Sports is nothing short of phenomenal. Through his institutions, he has nurtured 23 Olympians & 3 Paralympians, created a massive sports infrastructure and promoted sports persons – contributing to physical fitness, national unity, and social integration. His humanitarian efforts have touched countless lives. Despite all his achievements and accolades and access to luxuries, he leads a simple life and remains a bachelor who embodies humility and compassion.
Prof Achyuta Samanta’s life story is one of inspiration and hope. It is a testament to the indomitable human spirit, and the power of hard work, perseverance, and social responsibility to transform lives and create a better world. His unwavering commitment to the betterment of society, both as a policymaker and a social activist, serves as a shining example for one and all.

Welcome to the dynamic world of sports at KIIT & KISS, where we champion the ethos of holistic development through sports. Under the visionary leadership of Dr. Samanta, our institutions have become synonymous with sporting excellence and innovation, mirroring the standards of the best universities globally.
At KIIT & KISS, sports are not just activities but a way of life, integral to our educational philosophy. Our commitment is reflected in our world-class infrastructure, encompassing a vast athletics stadium, state-of-the-art cricket and rugby grounds, a velodrome, and a multitude of sports complexes. These facilities not only cater to the needs of our athletes but also serve as a fertile ground for nurturing future champions.
Unique Recognition






At KIIT & KISS, the inception of a sporting legacy began with Dr. Samanta’s pioneering vision. Recognising the transformative power of sports, akin to models in Western universities, Dr. Samanta embarked on a mission to create an unparalleled sporting infrastructure. His dedication has been instrumental in fostering a culture where sports are synonymous with recreation, wellness, and mental fortitude..
KIIT’s sports infrastructure is a testament to excellence. With facilities like an expansive athletics stadium, cricket and rugby grounds, a velodrome, and a combined hockey/football stadium, KIIT stands as a beacon of international standard sports infrastructure. Complemented by 18 sports complexes, Olympic-sized swimming pools, and high-performance gyms, KIIT’s facilities are lauded by dignitaries and sporting legends alike.
KIIT & KISS are not just about world-class facilities but are the nurturing ground for over 300 dedicated sports personnel and 5000+ tribal athletes. The success stories range from international medallists to champions in various national and school-level competitions. KIIT & KISS are the epitomes of sporting prowess, making significant contributions to India’s sporting landscape.
Embracing inclusivity, KIIT & KISS have made monumental strides in introducing sports like Rugby and Chess, with KISS being the first in India to integrate Chess into its academic curriculum. The institutions’ commitment to inclusivity is further highlighted through establishing sports academies and introducing sports in rural areas, fostering a diverse range of talents.
With 12 Olympians already part of the KIIT family, Dr. Samanta’s ambition doesn’t rest. The goal is now set to send 10 more athletes to the 2024 Olympics. This relentless pursuit of excellence ensures that KIIT & KISS are not just universities but talent incubators, poised to redefine India’s sports narrative.
Dr. Samanta’s vision extends beyond current achievements. His aim is to instil quality sporting facilities in schools and colleges, ensuring that future stars are nurtured from the grassroots level. This model, if emulated by other universities, can revolutionise sports in India.

Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar had the proud distinction to be the host university of the inaugural Khelo India University Games (KIUG) 2020 held from February 22 to March 1, 2020. The largest-of-its-kind sports extravaganza was inaugurated by Shri Narendra Modi, Hon’ble Prime Minister of India through video conferencing in the presence of Chief Guest, Shri Naveen Patnaik, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Odisha and a host of dignitaries. For nine days, KIIT campus turned into mini-India as 4000 top athletes from 250 universities from across the country showcased their talent in 34 events spanning 17 sports disciplines.
KIUG 2020 is the most prestigious meet yet under the Govt. of India’s flagship Khelo India, a national programme for the development of sports launched in 2018 and a dream project of the Prime Minister. The multi-discipline meet is slated to be an annual event under the aegis of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Govt. of India, Ministry of HRD, Sports Authority of India (SAI) and Association of Indian Universities (AIU). It is not surprising that the inaugural edition came to Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, which of late has emerged as the sporting capital of the country. The Govt. of Odisha and the Chief Minister provided all kinds of support and cooperation to make the meet a huge success

Arsenic and other co-occurring pollutants in the environment have been an issue of major concern in the last decades because of the serious impact on human health coming from drinking water and certain foods with low-medium levels of pollutants for prolonged periods. Globally, more than 100 million people are at risk. Since 2006, eight events of the International Congress on “Arsenic in the Environment” have been held in different areas of the world: Mexico 2006, Spain 2008, Taiwan 2010, Australia 2012, Argentina 2014, Sweden 2016, China 2018, and The Netherlands 2021.
Arsenic and co-occurring pollutants in drinking water (mainly groundwater) have emerged as a global health concern. Over the past three decades, India has been at the forefront of research on arsenic biogeochemical cycling, health effects, technologies for arsenic removal, and sustainable mitigation measures. However, research on other pollutants, like different organic and inorganic contaminants, trace elements, bio-medical pollutants, micro/nano-plastics, etc., has been explored extensively in the Indian subcontinent and South Asia as well. During the last decade, the presence of arsenic and other pollutants in edible items, possibly also other food of plant origins, has attained increasing attention. This is particularly true in several other South and Southeast Asian countries, to ensure food safety and avoid further health hazards from consuming food that has been contaminated, it is essential to comprehend these agricultural penalties.
With a global perspective, the 9th International Congress & Exhibition on Arsenic in the Environment will take place at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) in the city of Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India, from 20th – 24th  October 2024. Known as As2024, the Congress will be themed “Arsenic and Other Pollutants, Water Security and One Health under Global Climate Change Scenario” and endorsed by the Executive Board of the International Society of Groundwater for Sustainable Development, Sweden.
Congress and Exhibition is Arsenic and Other Pollutants, Water Security and One Health under Global Climate Change Scenario (As2024), and will include the following themes:
Theme 1: Arsenic in natural environment
Theme 2: Arsenic in food and agricultural ecosystem
Theme 3: Health perspectives of environmental arsenic
Theme 4: Advancements in clean water technologies for arsenic removal and immobilization
Theme 5: Sustainable mitigation and management
In addition to these five themes, we will include 5 Special Sessions which will covers the legacy (trace elements, organic and inorganic pollutants, etc.) and emerging contaminants (micro/nano-plastics, per- and polyfluorinated substances, endocrine disrupting chemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc.) but is not limited to the following topics:
Session 1: Source and distribution of pollutants in different natural settings
Session 2: Advancements in clean water technologies for pollutant removal and immobilization
Session 3: Pollutants in dietary systems and health perspectives
Session 4: Policies and sustainable management of pollutants
Session 5: Sensors, innovation, technologies, and artificial intelligence for pollution monitoring and management
